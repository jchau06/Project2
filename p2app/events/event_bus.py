# An intermediary that routes events to the parts of the application that are
# meant to handle them.
#
# * Most events are routed to the engine to be processed, with the engine's
#   results routed back to the user interface.
# * The user interface's internal events are routed back to the user interface
#   to be processed, with the engine never seeing them.
